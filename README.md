# Spam-Email-detection
Project Description:
The project implements a spam email detection system using machine learning. The model classifies emails into two categories: spam and non-spam (ham). 
It utilizes a dataset and machine learning models to perform the classification.

Upload the spam.csv dataset to Google Colab using the Files tab or directly from Google Drive.
You can also create a README.md file to explain the dataset.
Create a new notebook in Colab for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
Since Google Colab runs Python code in the notebook, you can place the code in cells within the notebook itself, rather than in separate files.
Colab already has most necessary libraries installed, but if you need additional ones (like specific versions of packages), you can install them using !pip install <package-name>.
You donâ€™t need main.py in Colab. All the steps can be run in one notebook file.
README.md
You can include a project description within the notebook or keep it as a separate file in Google Drive.
LICENSE
You can still include a license, if necessary, in your Google Drive folder.
